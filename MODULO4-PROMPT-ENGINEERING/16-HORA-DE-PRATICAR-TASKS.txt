3) Use Python & JavaScript to encode input text (and output that text),
by shifting every character one character to the left. 


(
    PERSPECTIVE PROMPTING
)






You are an experienced developer, with years of developing efficient applications.

Write a Python and Javascript code that encodes input text (and outputs that text), by shifting 
every character one character to the left.






def encode_text(input_text):
    encoded_text = ""
    for char in input_text:
        if char.isalpha():
            encoded_char = chr(ord(char) - 1)
            if char.isupper():
                encoded_char = encoded_char.upper()
        else:
            encoded_char = char
        encoded_text += encoded_char
    return encoded_text

# Test the function
input_text = input("Enter the text to encode: ")
encoded_text = encode_text(input_text)
print("Encoded Text:", encoded_text)







function encodeText(inputText) {
  let encodedText = '';
  for (let i = 0; i < inputText.length; i++) {
    let char = inputText[i];
    if (/[a-zA-Z]/.test(char)) {
      let encodedChar = String.fromCharCode(char.charCodeAt(0) - 1);
      if (char === char.toUpperCase()) {
        encodedChar = encodedChar.toUpperCase();
      }
      encodedText += encodedChar;
    } else {
      encodedText += char;
    }
  }
  return encodedText;
}

// Test the function
const inputText = prompt("Enter the text to encode:");
const encodedText = encodeText(inputText);
console.log("Encoded Text:", encodedText);

A SOLUCAO DO PROFESSOR FOI ESTA:









You are an experienced web developer who's especially skilled with HTML & CSS.

Create a modern, minimal CV website showing your image and below that a list 
of your working experience and skills.



The structure of the website should be the following:


1. Main header with image of me + my name("Arthur Panazolo")
2. A section about my "Work Experience" with a list of my prior occupations
2.1 Head of Web Development, My Fictional Course Company Inc (2019-2022)
2.2 Lead Developer, My Fictional Course Company Inc (2015-2019)
2.3 Junior Developer, My Other Course Company Inc (2010-2015)
3. A section about my "Skills"
3.1 HTML, CSS, Javascript - 15 years of experience









------------------------------------







A SEGUNDA TASK:








You are an email-creation AI assistant 

Your goal is to write an engaging newsletter email that mentions two new 
blog posts.

Email recipients should be intrigued to click on the blog posts and 
read the full posts.

But before you write this email, you must ask me for any extra information you might need 
to improve the newsletter email you're about to write.

The two blog posts are:


1) The rise of machines: AI has the potential to shake up entire industries.
But there also are dangers that should be considered.


2) Prompt engineers needed! Prompt engineering is an important skill,

since it leads to a more efficient usage of ChatGPT and similar tools.














Thank you for providing the information about the two exciting blog posts! Before I start crafting the engaging newsletter email, could you please let me know the target audience for this email? Knowing the audience will help me tailor the content and language appropriately to capture their interest effectively. Additionally, if you have any specific points or key takeaways from the blog posts that you would like to highlight, please share them, as it will help me create a more compelling email. Once I have this information, I'll get started on writing the newsletter.
