










OK... SABER A IMPORTANCIA 



SOBRE CONTEXT,



E TER ALGUMAS IDEIAS DO QUE ADICIONAR NOS NOSSOS PROMPTS,

POR EXEMPLO:







1) PREFER SHORT, FOCUSED SENTENCES 



2) ADD IMPORTANT KEYWORDS AND AVOID __ UNNECESSARY INFORMATION




3) DEFINE THE TARGET AUDIENCE 



4) CONTROL TONE, STYLE E LENGTH OF THE OUTPUT 




5) CONTROL THE OUTPUT FORMAT (TEXT, JSON, UNFORMATTED MARKDOWN, ETC)...












--> PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT..









-> O PROFESSOR PREPAROU ALGUNS EXAMPLES,



COM OS QUAIS PODEMOS PRATICAR O QUE APRENDEMOS DURANTE AS ÚLTIMAS LICOES...











--> NA PRÓXIMA LICAO,
O PROFESSOR MOSTRARÁ COMO ELE 



FEZ ESSES EXEMPLOS, COMO ELE CRIOU PROMPTS QUE 


DAO 


AS MELHORES RESPONSES POSSÍVEIS..













TEMOS 3 EXEMPLOS, QUE DEVEMOS FEED AO CHATGPT 

E ENTAO 

DEVEMOS 

MELHORAR, PARA CONSEGUIR AS MELHORES RESPONSES POSSÍVEIS...
















-> DEVEMOS TENTAR DIFERENTES PROMPTS,

E TENTAR 
REFINAR 


O 
RESULTADO COM FOLLOWUP MESSGES...











--> O PROFESSOR QUER QUE PRATIQUEMOS...








--> DEVEMOS TER EM MENTE QUE O CHATGPT É DINAMICO --> OS EXATOS MESMOS 

PROMPTS NAO DARAO OS MESMOS RESULTADOS...







CERTO...








--> DEVEMOS PRATICAR O QUE APRENDEMOS,

PLAY AROUND COM DIFERENTES PROMPT STYLES E PEDACOS DE 
CONTEXT 


ADICIONADOS A ESSES PROMPTS...











OS EXEMPLOS SAO:









1) create a SHORT PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT TEXT FOR A NEW AI-POWERED 
WEBSITE GENERATOR.



MEU PROMPT:




You: You are the owner of a new, revolutionary AI-powered Website Generator. Create a short product announcement text to sell the application's features. The text must be less than 80 characters long.

AI: "Transforming Web Design: Our AI-Powered Website Generator!"

You: The text must be less than 200 characters long.

AI: "Introducing the Future of Web Design: AI-Powered Website Generator! Create Stunning Sites Effortlessly. Get Yours Today!"

You: The message must not contain the word "Future".

AI: "Unleash Your Website's Potential: AI-Powered Generator! Effortless Design. Get Yours Now!"

You: The text must be less than 300 characters long.

AI: "Revolutionize Your Web Design: AI-Powered Website Generator! Effortless Creation. Get Yours Today and Stand Out Online!"

You: The message must contain the word "creator".

AI: "Empower Your Creativity: AI-Powered Website Creator! Effortless Design. Build Stunning Sites Today!"








2) CREATE A PYTHON CODE SNIPPET THAT SEARCHES AND DELETES ALL 
.png AND .jpg FILES IN A GIVEN FOLDER 



User: Create a Python snippet that searches and deletes all .png and .jpg files in a given folder, with comments for each step of the code execution.


Assistant:
import os

def delete_png_and_jpg_files(folder_path):
    # Get a list of all files in the given folder
    files = os.listdir(folder_path)

    # Iterate over each file in the folder
    for file_name in files:
        # Create the full path to the file
        file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, file_name)

        # Check if the file is a regular file and ends with .png or .jpg extension
        if os.path.isfile(file_path) and (file_name.lower().endswith(".png") or file_name.lower().endswith(".jpg")):
            try:
                # Delete the file
                os.remove(file_path)
                print(f"Deleted: {file_path}")
            except OSError as e:
                print(f"Error deleting {file_path}: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Specify the folder path where you want to search for and delete .png and .jpg files
    folder_to_search = "/path/to/your/folder"

    # Call the function to delete .png and .jpg files in the specified folder
    delete_png_and_jpg_files(folder_to_search)






3) WRITE AN EMAIL TO A COLLEAGUE THAT YOU NEED FEEDBACK 
ON YOUR SUBMITTED PROTOTYPE UNTIL THE END OF THE WEEK....


User: You are a Web Developer waiting 
for feedback on a prototype submitted to
 a colleague, prototype which should be submitted 
 until the end of the week. Write a polite email requesting the feedback.



Assistant: Subject: Gentle Reminder: Request for Prototype Feedback

Dear [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to kindly remind you about the prototype I shared with you last week. I understand that you might be busy with your own tasks and responsibilities, but I was hoping to receive your valuable feedback on the prototype by the end of this week.

Your input and insights are crucial to the progress of this project, and your feedback will help us improve and refine the prototype before its final submission. I am eager to hear your thoughts on the design, functionality, and overall user experience.

Please don't hesitate to share any comments, suggestions, or concerns you might have. Your honest feedback is highly appreciated and will contribute significantly to the success of the project.
